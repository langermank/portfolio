<h2>I'm a self taught web developer with a background in graphic design. I love using code as a design tool and I'm interested in how code can connect design to engineering. Currently I'm building a design system at <a href="https://careers.cargurus.com/">CarGurus</a> as a Senior UI/UX Engineer. Outside of work I co-organize <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-That-UX-Boston/" alt="Ladies that UX Boston Meetup Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ladies that UX Boston</a>, a meetup group empowering women who work in design and technology.</h2>
