<p class="header4">With a background in graphic design and a history of tinkering with the web, I'm interested in how code connects design to engineering. Currently I'm building a design system at <a href="https://careers.cargurus.com/">CarGurus</a> as a Senior UI/UX Engineer. Outside of work I co-organize <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-That-UX-Boston/" alt="Ladies that UX Boston Meetup Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ladies that UX Boston</a>, a meetup group empowering women who work in design and technology.</p>
