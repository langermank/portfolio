<p class="header4">With a background in graphic design and a history of tinkering with the web, I'm interested in how code connects design to engineering. Currently I'm a Systems Designer at GitHub working on <a href="https://primer.style/">Primer</a>. Outside of work I co-host <a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/complementary/episodes/51-Thoughts-on-the-book-Do-Design-Why-beauty-is-the-key-to-everything-by-Alan-Moore-e2ua8qh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complementary</a>, an interface design podcast.</p>
